    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <ls>Russet potatos</ls>
            <ls>Egg</ls>
            <ls>Flour</ls>
            <ls>Ricotta cheese</ls>
            <ls>Salt and pepper</ls>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <ls>Wash potatos and bake them in the oven at 450F for 45-60 min.
            </ls>
            <ls>Peel potatos and cut each one into 4 slives. Use a potato ricer to press each piece over a clean work surface.</ls>
            <ls>Drizzle 1 beaten egg over the potatos and dot the top of the potatos with bits of ricotta cheese.</ls>
            <ls>Mix 1tps salt and 1tsp pepper into 1 cup flour then sift the flour mixture over the potatoes.</ls>
            <ls>Mix everything together and gently knead, roll and fold the dough. Knead until flour is incorporated and a soft and smooth dough has formed.</ls>
            <ls>Roll dough into a log and divide into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into thin strips and cut strips into 1-inch pieces. Roll over a gnocci paddle for a ridge pattern. Transfer to a parchment-lined and four-dusted baking sheet.</ls>
            <ls>Cook gnocci in 3-4 batches in salted water. When they start to float, cook for 1 minute then lift with a sieve to drain then transfer to warm sauce or finish in a skillet.</ls>
        </ol>

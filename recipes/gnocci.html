    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Russet potatos</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
         <li>Wash potatos and bake them in the oven at 450F for 45-60 min.
        </li>
        <li>Peel potatos and cut each one into 4 slives. Use a potato ricer to press each piece over a clean work surface.</li>
        <li>Drizzle 1 beaten egg over the potatos and dot the top of the potatos with bits of ricotta cheese.</li>
        <li>Mix 1tps salt and 1tsp pepper into 1 cup flour then sift the flour mixture over the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Mix everything together and gently knead, roll and fold the dough. Knead until flour is incorporated and a soft and smooth dough has formed.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a log and divide into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into thin strips and cut strips into 1-inch pieces. Roll over a gnocci paddle for a ridge pattern. Transfer to a parchment-lined and four-dusted baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cook gnocci in 3-4 batches in salted water. When they start to float, cook for 1 minute then lift with a sieve to drain then transfer to warm sauce or finish in a skillet.</li>
     </ol>
